    <h4>Textbook ELAB is an ingenius application that can help anyone in school. Whether you're in highschool or in gradschool. Textbook Elab can help you! me personally, I have a hard time learning new materal from text books, I have to read it over and over to actually grasp the materal due to the small text and advanced language. So for all the students like me, here's Textbook ELAB.  With Textbook ELAB, you can make your own account wich keeps records of which textbooks you searched, along with the chapter and section. You can search the name of the textbook, the chapter of the materal, and the specific section the materal is on. After you have done that, There will be a page that pulls up that shows an actual picture of that page you've selected, and it'll ask you, is this the page you requested? you press either yes or no. If you press no, A page will pull up with all the page images from the book chapter you selected, separated by section. After that, you will choose which page that is. Then a deep elaboration page will pull up. But if you chose yes, A page will pull up giving you a deep comprehensive elaboration on the materal, along with comments  from other Textbook ELAB users. So Textbook ELAB is also like a social network for helping students. Textbook ELAB users can get help with the materal from textbook ELAB itself and also from other Textbook ELAB users.</h4>
